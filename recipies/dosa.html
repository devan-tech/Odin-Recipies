        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Take all the ingredients to prepare the dosa batter. Rice, urad dal and fenugreek seeds are the main
                ingredients. Chana dal is used for getting a golden color for Dosa.</li>
            <li>Rinse both types of rice (regular rice and parboiled rice) together in water for 3-4 times and soak them
                in 2 cups of water for 4-5 hours – (Place both types of rice in a medium-size bowl and fill it with
                water till 3/4th height. Rinse the rice by rubbing them between your fingertips; the water will turn
                cloudy. Drain the water and repeat</li>
            <li>Rinse urad dal and chana dal together in water, add fenugreek seeds and soak in 1 cup water for 4-5
                hours.</li>
            <li>Drain water from urad dal in a small bowl and reserve it (it will be used in the next step while
                grinding the dal). Add drained urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds mixture in the medium jar of a
                mixer grinder or blender.</li>
            <li>Add water as needed and grind until smooth and fluffy batter (use water reserved in previous step,
                approx. 1½ cups water will required to grind 1/2 cup dry urad dal).</li>
            <li>The batter should be fluffy and not very thick. Transfer it to a large container.</li>
            <li>Drain water from rice and add them to the same mixer grinder jar. Depending on the size of the jar, you
                can ground the rice in multiple batches.</li>
            <li>Add water as needed and grind until smooth texture. Don’t add too much water in a single go; add 1-2
                tablespoons water at a time (approx. 1/2 cup water will required). </li>
            <li>Add salt and mix both batters well using spoon. The final batter should not be too thick or too watery.
                Cover it with plate and leave it at room temperature for 8-10 hours or overnight for fermentation.</li>
            <li>Heat non-stick tava or iron tava (skillet or griddle) over medium flame. Sprinkle few drops of water on
                the surface. If water drops sizzle and evaporate within few seconds, tava is hot enough to cook. </li>
            <li>Apply 1/2-teaspoon oil on the griddle and spread it evenly with a spatula or a clean wet cloth. Take a
                ladle full of batter, pour it over the surface of tawa, swirl it as thin as possible in a spiral motion
                by rotating ladle and make it into round shape of approx. 7-8 inch diameter circle.</li>
            <li>Apply 1-teaspoon oil (or ghee / butter for crispy dosa) around the edges of dosa (or spread
                oil/ghee/butter evenly with brush for crispy dosa).</li>
            <li>Cook until the bottom surface turns light brown and the edges start to come upward, it will take around
                2-minutes.</li>
            Flip it and cook for a minute. If you are making thin dosa (as shown in the photo), you do not need to cook
            the other side. Transfer it to a plate. Wipe tava with clean wet cloth before making next dosa (this is to
            prevent dosa from sticking to Pan) and repeat the process from step-11 to step-13 for remaining batter. Hot
            and crispy plain dosa is ready.
