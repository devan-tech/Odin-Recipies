            <li>Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make kewra water. Set them aside for later usage. Now
                chop the onion and coriander leaves and keep them aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat refined oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds, bay
                leaf, green cardamom, black cardamom, cloves in it, and saute for about a minute.</li>
            <li>Then, add chopped onion to it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it with slit green chillies,

            <li>Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with ginger julienned, coriander and
                mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose water and saffron water in it. Cook till the chicken is tender. </li>
            <li>Then add 1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly. Then add saffron water and pour ghee over it. You can now
